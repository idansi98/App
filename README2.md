npm start - run the app  
Open http://localhost:port to start the app (default is 3000)  

After the app is on, you are at the login page.  
If you are already registered - you can log-in and you will be redirected to your chat page without refreshing.  
If you have not registered yet, you should go to the registering page, and fill in all the required form. For now This will also give the new user a few open chats.  


After you are at the chat page, you have multiple options:
You can send a text-message, you can also send a voice-message and either an image or video message .
You can also add new chat to your chats list, and another additional feature our App supports in is searching a user by his display name at the contacts list.
